        <p id="postDesc">For the people out there that are newer to web development. I am going to tell you the difference between react and react native. React is a JavaScript library of reusable components designed to create apps. React native is designed to build native mobile apps with reusable components. As you can see both are similar definitions but using them are fundamentally different. For instance instead of using paragraph tags like you would in React, you use Text tags instead. </p>
