        <p id="postDesc">This is my opinion of Samsung's new folding phone the Galaxy ZFlip 4. I recently was able to obtain this phone through Google Fi's bring a number deal and I have to say it is quite amazing. While not quite a flagship phone it is the closest thing I've ever had to one and the most expensive phone I've ever had. I would defintely recommend this to anyone else trying to decide if they want another phone. </p>
