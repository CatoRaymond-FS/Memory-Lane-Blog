        <p id="postDesc">This is game is called Learn to Code RPG. It is created by the people that run the website Free Code Camp. The game is fairly simple, it gives you stats of different knowledge areas in CS. You learn concepts and answer questions as the game progresses and it seems like a fun way to learn to code. I'm going to try it out soon! </p>
