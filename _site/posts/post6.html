        <p id="postDesc">Authentication, you hear it everywhere in the technology world from social media at home to employee portals at work. I've recently had a chance to build an api with authenticatio and it was a wild ride. At first it was a little hard to keep up with everything going on but compartmentalizing your code into different services and middleware help. It's very important to portect your api routes so not just any person has access to your content. This also transfers over to other websites and apps. User authentication is all over the web and it's an important skill to learn as a web developer.</p>
