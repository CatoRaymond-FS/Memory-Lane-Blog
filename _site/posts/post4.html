        <p id="postDesc">An API is an Application Programming Interface, this piece of software lets two applications talk to each other usually a front end and a back end. Building one without a front end might not be as hard as you think! The most important step is why you're building it, this becomes your model and you base the rest of your api off of that. You give ther user fields to enter the appropriate information in and then save it to your database. There this information can be recalled and deleted as necessary! </p>
